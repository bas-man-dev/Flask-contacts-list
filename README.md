# Contacts List Project

A project using python and react/js to create a contact list.
React was imported using vite@latest

## Initial Version

The original version is a hastily put together application. MVP.

### Things which need be tidied

- Tests need to be done
- Style is in great need of tidying up
- Accessibility needs improving
- Code could be tidied up and made neater

### Things which could also be done

- Change code into typescript?
- Create a better database system so the contacts can actually be saved rather than only working for one session

## Improved version
